# 🔧 Medicine Alarm Troubleshooting Guide

## ✅ **FIXES APPLIED**

### **Issue 1: Alarms Not Working** ✅ FIXED
**Problem:** Alarm notifications were not triggering even with schedules created.

**Root Cause:** The alarm service wasn't checking if `reminderEnabled` was true before triggering alarms.

**Solution Applied:**
- Added check for `schedule.reminderEnabled` in alarm service
- Alarms now only trigger for schedules with reminders enabled
- Better notification message with dosage info and action link

### **Issue 2: No Clear All Button** ✅ FIXED
**Problem:** Users couldn't delete all notifications at once.

**Solution Applied:**
- Added "Clear All Notifications" button in notification panel
- Confirmation dialog before clearing
- Success/error toast messages
- Works alongside "Mark All as Read" button

## 🔔 **HOW ALARMS WORK NOW**

### **Automatic Alarm System:**

   - Schedule has `reminderEnabled = true`
   - Schedule is active (today's date in range)
   - Alarm not already triggered in last 5 minutes

4. **When alarm triggers:**
   - 🔊 Plays 3 beeps (800Hz sound)
   - 📱 Shows browser notification
   - 📬 Creates in-app notification
   - 🔴 Updates red badge count
   - 📝 Logs to console
