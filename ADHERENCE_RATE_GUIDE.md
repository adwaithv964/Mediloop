# 📊 Adherence Rate - Complete Guide

## 🎯 **WHAT IS ADHERENCE RATE?**

**Adherence Rate** measures how consistently you take your medicines according to your scheduled doses.

### **Simple Explanation:**
```
Adherence Rate = (Doses You Took / Doses You Should Have Taken) × 100%
```

### **Example:**
```
This Week (7 days):
  Scheduled: 21 doses (3 per day × 7 days)
  Taken: 18 doses
  
  Adherence Rate = (18 / 21) × 100 = 85.7% ≈ 86%
```

## 📈 **HOW IT'S CALCULATED**

### **Calculation Period:**
- **Last 7 Days** (rolling window)
- Updates automatically every day
- Reflects recent behavior

### **What Counts:**

## 🔧 **TECHNICAL DETAILS**

### **Calculation Logic:**
```typescript
For each schedule in last 7 days:
  1. Count expected doses:
     - Days schedule was active
     - Times per day in schedule
     
  2. Count taken doses:
     - Marked as "taken" (not skipped)
     - Within date range
     - Matching schedule and time
     
  3. Calculate:
     Adherence = (Total Taken / Total Expected) × 100
     Round to nearest whole number
```

### **Edge Cases:**
- **No schedules**: Shows 0%
- **New user**: Accurate after marking doses
- **Schedule just started**: Counts from start date
- **Schedule ended**: Doesn't count ended schedules

## 📊 **TRACKING OVER TIME**

### **7-Day Rolling Window:**
```
Today: Oct 25
Window: Oct 19 - Oct 25

Tomorrow: Oct 26
Window: Oct 20 - Oct 26 (rolls forward)
```

### **Why 7 Days?**
- Recent behavior indicator
- Not too short (daily fluctuations)
- Not too long (reflects current habits)
- Medical standard period
